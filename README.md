## Introduction

Explain the purpose and context of the project. What does the recommendation system do? Mention the methods used, such as collaborative filtering and content-based filtering.

## Setup

List the prerequisites for running the code, such as Python version, required libraries, and any external data sources.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Explain how to use the code. Provide code examples or instructions on how to run the recommendation system. If there are multiple scripts or notebooks, detail their purposes.

```bash
python train.py
python test.py
```

## Data

Explain the data used in the project. Mention the data sources, format, and any preprocessing steps applied. Provide links to where the data can be downloaded or access to the dataset if applicable.

## Model

Describe the architecture of the model used, such as the neural network structure, embeddings, and any other relevant details. If there are any special considerations for the model, mention them here.

## Training

Explain how the model is trained, including hyperparameters, loss functions, and optimizers used. If there are important implementation details, mention them here.

## Evaluation

Detail how the model's performance is evaluated. Mention the metrics used for evaluation, such as RMSE, precision, recall, and F1-score. If there are optimal thresholds or other considerations, include them.

## Results

Include the results of running the recommendation system, such as performance metrics, graphs, or charts. Discuss the findings and any insights gained from the results.

## Contributing

Explain how others can contribute to the project. Include guidelines for submitting issues, making pull requests, and any coding standards to follow.
